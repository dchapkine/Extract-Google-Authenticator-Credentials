This was tested only with google authenticator v5.00 on android 9 (rooted)

Scripts in this repository highly depend on sqlite database schema of google authenticator app.
So it the schema changes in new versions this method could break until I update the repository.

If it breaks for you, please open an issue with following information:
- google authenticator exact version (you can check it in settings > about)
- android exact version
- any other information about the error


## It doesn't work

Sure it does !

The only thing that can fail here is time synchronisation between your different devices and different authenticator app vendors.

Please check that both old and new devices have the same timezone and time

Try to play with "offset compensation" feature in authenticator settings if codes don't match

Keep in mind that you won't be able to have perfect match between two different devices. You may experience 10 seconds offset between two devices. 


## Does it work on linux/osx/windows ?

Should work everywhere as long as you have all dependencies installed (see below):
- linux (tested on ubuntu 14.04)
- macos/osx
- windows via cygwin


## Step1
Root your phone that has google authenticator installed

## Step2
Install adb on your pc/mac

## Step3
Make sure you have netcat (nc), adb and bash installed on your machine

## Step4
Connect your phone to the computer via usb

## Step5
Check that you can see the device using the command: adb devices. If not, ensure that debugging is enabled on the phone's settings and the computer is trusted.

## Step6
If yes, run ./extract.sh

## Step7
If no error showed, it means it worked and the file is not inside data/databases

## Step8
run ./server.sh

## Step9
goto http://localhost:2001 in your browser

## Step10
Here you go, hover your mouse on one of blue squares, qrcode is shown.
Open google authenticator on new device, and scan each code

## Step11
Congratulations if you made it so far, your google authenticator codes are now transfered to your new device.
Before you remove your codes from old device, make sure that one time passwords generated by google authenticator are EXACTLY the same on both devices.
Note that both devices should have correct datetime set
Thank you for using this guide :)

## Step12
Now that you understand the process, you can run ./main.sh to do all this steps in one command
Enjoy !
